我叫玛丽·艾莉丝·杨
My name is Mary Alice Young.

3
00:00:19,450 --> 00:00:21,160
如果你看了今天的早报
When you read this morning's paper,

4
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,440
可能会读到一篇报道
you may come across an article

5
00:00:22,550 --> 00:00:25,880
有关我上周异常的一天
about the unusual day I had last week.

6
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:29,480
通常  我的生活没有任何新闻价值
Normally, there's never anything newsworthy about my life,

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:32,390
然而  直到上周四  一切都改变了
but that all changed last thursday.

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,190
起初每件事情都显得很平常
Of course, everything seemed quite normal at first.

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:38,100
我为家人准备早餐
I made breakfast for my family.

10
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,300
做家务
I performed my chores.

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,500
完成手工制作
I completed my projects.

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:50,140
取回干洗的衣服
I ran my errands.

13
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,440
事实上  这天太平常不过了
In truth, I spent the day as I spent every other day,

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,570
平静地打理着家里的一切
quietly polishing the routine of my life

15
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:00,890
直至完美
until it gleamed with perfection.

16
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,590
这就是为什么
That's why it was so astonishing when

17
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,920
当我走向走廊的壁橱
I decided to go to my hallway closet

18
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,910
拿出从没用过的左轮手枪时
and retrieve a revolver

19
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,760
会如此令人震惊了
that had never been used.

20
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,310
第一个发现我尸体的是
My body was discovered by my neighbor,

21
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:21,670
我的邻居玛莎·胡博太太
Mrs. Martha Huber,

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,140
她被这突如其来的声音吓了一跳
who'd been startled by a strange popping sound.

23
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,410
受好奇心驱使 她想到一个
Her curiosity aroused, Mrs. Huber tried to think of a reason

24
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:31,220
不请自来的理由
for dropping in on me unannounced.

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,390
片刻犹豫之后
After some initial hesitation,

26
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,110
她决定把半年前
she decided to return the blender she

27
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,900
借去的搅拌机还给我
had borrowed from me six months before.

28
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:05,730
我的邻居  她被枪击了
It's my neighbor. I think she's been shot.

29
00:02:05,730 --> 00:02:07,640
地上全是血
There's blood everywhere.

30
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,620
是的  快派救护车过来
Yes, you've got to send an ambulance.

31
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,590
赶快
You've got to send one right now.

32
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,070
然后  有那么一会
And, for a moment,

33
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:21,670
胡博太太静静地站在厨房里
Mrs. Huber stood motionless in her kitchen,

34
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,730
陷入了深深的悲伤
grief-stricken by this senseless tragedy.

35
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,430
但  仅数秒而已
But only for a moment.

36
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,310
如果说胡博太太有什么优点
If there was one thing Mrs. Huber was known for,

37
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,210
那就是凡事她都往积极的一面去想
it was her ability to look on the bright side.

38
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:38,910
《绝望的主妇》第一季 第一集

39
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,350
我的葬礼在星期一

葬礼结束后  紫藤郡的邻居们
After the funeral, all the residents of Wisteria Lane

41
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,460
都去我家表达他们的哀思
came to pay their respects.

42
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,170
他们按照惯例
And, as people do in these situations,

43
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,760
带来了食物
they brought food.

44
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,400
勒奈特·斯加沃带了炸鸡
Lynette Scavo brought fried chicken.

45
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,560
勒奈特家有很棒的炸鸡秘方
Lynette had a great family recipe for fried chicken.

46
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,400
当然  当她还在职场打拼的时候
Of course, she didn't cook much

47
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,300
她很少做饭
while moving up the corporate ladder.

48
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,140
因为没时间
She didn't have the time.

49
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,070
但当被告知怀孕后
But when her doctor announced she was pregnant,

50
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,780
她的老公汤姆有了主意
her husband Tom had an idea.

51
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,610
"你不如辞职吧"
"Why not quit your job?"

52
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,010
"全职妈妈有利于孩子的成长"
"Kids do better with stay-at-home moms."

53
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,150
"这样压力也会小很多"
"It would be so much less stressful."

54
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,230
现实却不尽如人意
But this was not the case.

55
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,390
勒奈特的日子变得更加忙碌
In fact, Lynette's life had become so hectic

56
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,150
以至于她不得不去快餐店
she was now forced to get her chicken

57
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:25,590
点了份外卖炸鸡
from the fast-food restaurant.

58
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,410
如果勒奈特回头想想
Lynette would've appreciated

59
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,400
她会发现一切都背道而驰
the irony if she'd thought about it.

60
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,530
可惜  她根本没时间
But she couldn't. She didn't have the time.

61
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,900
-都给我停下来  -但是  妈妈
- Stop it, stop it, stop it. - But, mom.

62
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,140
别这样  你们今天得乖乖的
No. You are going to behave today.

63
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,790
我不想在整条街的邻居
I am not going to be humiliated

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,940
面前丢脸
in front of the entire neighborhood.

65
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,540
你们要知道  我不是说说而已
And, just so you know how seerious I am...

66
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,590
那是什么
What's that?

67
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,850
圣诞老人的手机号码
Santa's cell-phone number.

68
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,720
你怎么得到的
How did you get that?

69

我朋友的朋友认识一个小精灵
I know someone who knows someone who knows an elf.

70
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,920
如果今天你们谁捣蛋
And if any of you acts up,

71
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,660
相信我  我会打电话给圣诞老人
so help me, I will call Santa

72
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,700
告诉他  圣诞节你们只想要袜子
and I will tell him you want socks for Christmas.

73
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,890
想试试吗
Are you willing to risk that?

74
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:05,630
好  那就乖乖的吧
Ok. Let's get this over with.

她的品位有了很大的提升
Gabrielle had developed a taste

加布丽尔被他的泪水打动了
Gabrielle was touched when tears welled up in his eyes.

84
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,300
但她很快发现

85
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,600
卡洛斯每做成一笔大生意时都会这样

不经意提到就好
Look, just work it into the conversation.

00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,420
卡洛斯  我做不到很随意地插话

却还做不好

生命中有个男人还是挺好的

因为有时候人们很不开心

00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,990
觉得自杀是解决问题的唯一办法
they think that's the only way to solve their problems.

153
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,790
-杨太太看起来总是很开心啊  -没错
- Mrs. Young always seemed happy. - Yeah.

154
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,210
有时候人们表现出一面
Sometimes people pretend to be one way,

155
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,400
而内心却是截然不同的一面
when they're totally different on the inside.

156
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,650
就像爸爸的女朋友满脸微笑
Oh, you mean like how dad's girlfriend always smiling and says

157
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,000
讲话动听  但我们都知道她是个贱女人
nice things, but we know she's a bitch.

158
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:31,240
朱莉  我不喜欢你用那个词
I don't like that word, Julie.

159
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,140
不过  这个例子很棒
But, yeah, that's a great example.

160
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,340
感谢你们的到来
You're welcome.

161
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,520
怎么样了
What's going on?

162
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,920
对不起我来晚了
Sorry I'm late.

163
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,730
-嗨  苏珊  -嗨
- Hi, Susan. - Hey.

164
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:15,320
当你跟卡尔对质的时候他怎么说
So, what did Karl say when you confronted him?

165
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:17,870
说得可好了  他说
You'll love this. He said...

166
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,330
"这根本不能说明什么  仅仅是性而已"
"It doesn't mean anything. It was just sex."

167
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,360
哦  是啊  花花公子手册第一页
Ah, yes, page one of the philanderer's handbook.

168
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,040
是啊  然后他就一脸无辜地对我说
Yeah, and then he got this zen look on his face,

169
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,590
"你知道  苏珊
and he said, "you know, Susan,

170
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,930
大多数男人都生活在平静的绝望之中"
most men live lives of quiet desperation."

171
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,400
告诉我你揍他了
Please tell me you punched him.

172
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,570
没有  我说 "真的吗  那么大多数女人
No. I said, "Really? And what do most women

173
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,230
吵吵闹闹的一生又算什么"
lead lives of noisy fulfillment?"

174
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:35,920
说得好
Hmm. Good for you.

175
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,080
我是说  那么多人
I mean, of all people,

176
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,510
你就非要搞上自己的秘书吗
did he have to bang his secretary?

177
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,210
我还给那女人做过早午餐
I had that woman over for brunch.

178
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,970
正如我祖母常说的那样
It's like my grandmother always said --

179
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,380
男人那儿硬的时候没有良知可言
an erect penis doesn't have a conscience.

180
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:46,010
即使不硬也是没什么良知
Even the limp ones aren't that ethical.

181
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,920
这也是我加入枪支协会的原因之一
This is half the reason I joined the NRA.

182
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:50,550
当雷克斯开始参加那些医学会议时
Well, when Rex started going to those medical conferences,

183
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,630
我希望他明白
I wanted it in the back of his mind that

184
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:53,250
家里有个很爱他的妻子
he had a loving wife at home

185
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,890
和一把上了膛的沃森左轮手枪
with a loaded Smith & Wesson.

186
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:57,980
勒奈特  汤姆总是出差
Lynnie, Tom's always away on business.

187
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,230
你不担心他会发生什么事吗
Do you ever worry he might?

188
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:03,000
拜托  这个男人让我四年里怀了三次孕
Oh, please, the man's gotten me pregnant three times in four years.

189
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:05,560
我倒希望他去和别人做爱
I wish he was having sex with someone else.

190
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:11,200
所以  苏珊  他还会再见那个女人吗
So, Susan, is he gonna stop seeing that woman?

191
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,450
我也不知道
I don't know.

192
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:22,320
抱歉  姐妹们  我只是
I'm sorry, you guys, I just...

193
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:28,000
我不知道自己要怎么熬过去
I just don't know how I'm gonna survive this.

194
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,160
听我说
Listen to me.

195
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,790
我们都有绝望的时候
We all have moments of desperation.

196
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,080
当我们熬过去的时候
If we can face them head-on, that's when

197
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,000
就会发现自己有多强大
we'd find out how strong we really are.

198
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,680
苏珊
Susan.

199
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,980
苏珊
Susan.

200
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:50,920
我说保罗请我们周五过来
I was just saying Paul wants us to go over on friday.

201
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,700
帮他整理玛丽·艾莉丝的衣橱
He needs us to go to Mary Alice's closet

202
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,510
收拾下她的遗物
and help pack up her things.

203
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:55,520
他说他不能独自面对
He says he can't face doing it by himself.

204
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,490
-好啊  没问题  -你还好吧
- Sure. That's fine. - Are you ok?

205
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,430
没事  我就是太生气了
Yeah. I'm just so angry.

206
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,640
如果玛丽·艾莉丝当时有问题
If Mary Alice was having problems,

207
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,730
她应该告诉我们  让我们帮她
she should have come to us. She should've let us help her.

208
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,700
她能有什么问题  她很健康
What problems could she have had? She was healthy,

209
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,370
舒适的房子  和睦的家庭  她的人生就是
had a great home, a nice family. Her life was...

210
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,600
我们的翻版
Our life.

211
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,800
不会的  如果当时玛丽·艾莉丝有危机
No. If Mary Alice was having a crisis,

212
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,670
我们会发现的
we'd have known.

213
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,840
她住的那么近
She lives 50 feet away, for god sakes.

214
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,050
加布  那个女人都已经自杀了
Gabby, the woman killed herself.

215
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,150
这事没这么简单
Something must've been going on.

216
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:42,960
-如果我是你  我绝不吃那东西  -为什么
- I wouldn't eat that if I were you. - Why?

217
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,470
那是我做的  相信我
I made it. Trust me.

218
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,500
等等  你有什么遗愿吗
Hey, hey, do you have a death wish?

219
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:52,140
没有  我不相信有人连
No, I just refused to believe that anybody

220
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,480
乳酪通心粉都不会做
can screw up macaroni and cheese.

221
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,450
哦  天哪
Oh, my god.

222
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,440
你怎么能  这吃起来就像
How did you...? It tastes like

223
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,180
烤焦了但又没熟
it's burnt and undercooked.

224
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,520
是啊  我经常这样  接着
Yeah, I get that a lot. Here you go.

225
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,260
谢谢  我是麦克·德尔非诺
Thanks. I'm Mike Delfino.

226
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,560
我刚租下隔壁赛蒙家的房子
I just started renting the Sims' house next door.

227
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,330
苏珊·梅尔  我住对面
Susan Mayer. I live across the street.

228
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,920
胡博太太跟我说过你
Mrs. Huber told me about you,

229
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,240
说你为儿童书画插画
said you illustrate children's books.

230
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,670
是啊  五岁以下的孩子都知道我
Yeah, I'm very big with the under-five set.

231
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,510
你是做什么的
What do you do?

232
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:27,480
水管工  所以万一你有东西堵住了
Plumber. So if you ever have a clog...

233
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,380
或是别的什么
...or something.

234
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,450
现在大家都看到我带来的东西了
Now that everybody's seen that I brought something,

235
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,820
我应该早点把它扔了
I should probably just throw this out.

236
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:55,870
轻点  小冤家
Ease up, you little vampire.

237
00:11:56,310 --> 00:12:00,140
勒奈特  我到处找你
Lynette, I've been looking all over for you.

238
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,680
知道你的儿子们在干嘛吗
Are you aware of what your sons are doing?

239
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,120
大炮攻击
Cannonball!

240
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,780
停下来
Stop!

241
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,700
你们在干什么  这可是个告别会
What are you doing? We are at a wake.

242
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,180
天啊  你说我们可以游泳的
Oh my god. You said we could go in the pool.

243
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,430
我说的是你们可以在泳池旁边
I said you could go by the pool.

244
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,800
你们穿了泳衣
Do you have your swimsuits on?

245
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:28,840
穿了  出门前穿的
Yeah, we put 'em on ourselves before we left.

246
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,280
你们三个计划好的是吧  够了  出来
You three planned this? All right. That's it. Get out.

247
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,580
-不要  -不要
- No. - No?

248
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,550
我是你们的妈妈  照我说的做  快点
I am your mother. You have to do what I say. Come on.

249
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:41,950
我们想游泳  你阻止不了我们
We want to swim and you can't stop us!

250
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,660
劳驾
Here.

251
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,700
-别过来  -快出来
- No! - Get out.

252
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,430
以为我不会下来抓你们吗  出来
Think I won't get in this pool and just grab you? Get out!

253
00:12:58,430 --> 00:13:00,000
过来
Get over here.

254
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,340
过来
Get over here.

255
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,940
好的  胳膊伸过来
All right, give me your arm.

256
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,610
你
You...

257
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,480
这就对了  过来
That's right. Get over here.

258
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,920
快快快  走
Go, go, go, go, go. Move it.

259
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,360
出来  给我出来
Out. Get out.

260
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,990
保罗  我们得走了
Paul, we have to leave now.

261
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,710
你妻子的事我很遗憾
Once again, I am so sorry for your loss.

262
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,450
走
Go.

263
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:46,920
勒奈特用不着这么关心我丈夫
Lynette shouldn't have been so concerned about my husband.

264
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,550
他所担心的是那些不会浮出水面的秘密
He had other things on his mind. Things below the surface.

265
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,830
我葬礼第二天的早上  我的朋友们
The morning after my funeral, my friends

266
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,560
和邻居们就默默地回到了
and neighbors quietly went back

267
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,830
他们忙碌的生活中
to their busy, busy lives.

268
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:10,410
有的在做饭
While some did their cooking...

269
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,240
有的在打扫
...And some did their cleaning...

270
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,640
有的在做瑜伽
...And some did their yoga...

271
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,340
还有的
...Others...

272
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,220
在做"家庭作业"
...did their "homework".

273
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,990
你好
Hi...

274
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,860
我是朱莉  我把球踢到你家后院了
I'm Julie. I kicked my soccer ball into your backyard.

275
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,800
好的  那我们过去捡
Oh, ok. Well, let's go round and get it.

276
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,330
别出来
Stay

277
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,070
他妻子一年前死了  他本想留在洛杉矶
His wife died a year ago. He wanted to stay in LA,

278
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,500
但是那有太多回忆了
but here were too many memories.

279
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:38,950
税务原因他现在只能租房
He's renting for tax purposes,

280
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,400
但是他想尽快买一幢
but hopes to buy a place soon.

281
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,140
我不敢相信你竟然去那了
I can't believe you went over there

282
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,130
我看到你们在告别会上调情了
Hey, I saw you both flirting at the wake.

283
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,530
你们双方都有好感
You are obviously into each other

284
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,340
既然知道他单身  你就能约他啦
Now you know he's single, you can ask him out.

285
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:50,110
朱莉  我喜欢德尔菲诺先生  我承认
Julie, I like Mr. Delfino, I do.

286
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:53,050
我只是不知道自己是否准备好约会了
I just... I don't know if I'm ready to start dating yet.

287
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:55,190
你需要回到社交圈去
You need to get back out there.

288
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:58,350
你上次做爱是什么时候
Come on. How long has it been since you've had sex?

289
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:01,630
你生气了
Are you mad that I asked you that?

290
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,230
不是  我在想答案
No, I'm trying to remember.

291
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,860
我不想再跟你讨论我的情感生活了
I don't want to talk to you about my love life any more.

292
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,600
会刺激到我
It warns me out

293
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:08,970
我本来不应该说  只是
I wouldn't have said anything.It's just...

294
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,370
什么
What?

295
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:13,280
我听见爸爸的女朋友问
I heard dad's girlfriend ask if you'd

296
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:15,110
你离婚之后有没有约过谁
dated anyone since the divorce.

297
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:17,910
爸爸说他很怀疑
And dad said he doubted it.

298
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,940
然后他们都笑了
And then they both laughed.

299
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,260
嗨  苏珊
Hey, Susan.

300
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:40,990
嗨  麦克  我带了个搬家礼物给你
Hi, Mike. I brought you a little house-warming gift.

301
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,670
我应该早点送礼物过来的
I should've brought something by earlier, but

302
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:47,800
-实际上  你是第一个拜访的  -真的吗
- Actually, you're the first to stop by. - Really?

303
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,870
苏珊知道自己很幸运
Susan knew she was lucky.

304
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:52,780
-一个称心的单身汉搬到了紫藤郡  -欢迎
- An eligible bachelor had moved on to Wisteria Lane  - Welcome

305
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,840
而她又是第一个发现的
and she was the first to find out.

306
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,250
但她也知道  好消息
But she also knew that good news...

307
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,680
-你们好啊  -总是不胫而走
- Hello there. - ...Travels quickly.

308
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,000
伊迪·布利特是方圆五个街区内
Edie Britt was the most predatory

309
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,620
最风骚的离异女子
divorce in a five-block radius.

310
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,560
她的俘虏不计其数
Her conquests were numerous.

311
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,460
种类繁多
Varied.

312
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,430
如传奇一般
and legendary.

313
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,860
你好  苏珊  希望没打扰到你们
Hi, Susan. I hope I'm not interrupting.

314
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,030
你一定就是麦克·德尔非诺
You must be Mike Delfino.

315
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,140
你好  我是伊迪·布利特
Hi, I'm Edie... Britt.

316
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:28,110
我住那
I live over there.

317
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,550
欢迎搬来紫藤郡
Welcome to Wisteria Lane.

318
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,880
苏珊碰到对手了  还是个荡妇
Susan had met the enemy. And she was a slut.

319
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,010
谢谢  这是什么
Thank you. What's this?

320
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,080
茄汁香肠
Sausage puttanesca.

321
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,930
不过是我随便做的
It's just something I threw together.

322
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,960
谢谢  伊迪
Well, thanks, Edie.

323
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:46,640
真好  我应该请你们进来的
That's... great. I'd invite you both in,

324
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,470
但是我正在忙
but I was sort of in the middle of something.

325
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,140
我赴约就要迟到了
I'm late for an appointment.

326
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,600
我就是过来打个招呼
I just wanted to say hi.

327
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:55,970
就这样  麦克·德尔非诺之争开始了
And just like that, the race for Mike Delfino had begun.

328
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,940
有一瞬间  苏珊想她和伊迪说不定
For a moment, Susan wondered if her rivalry with Edie

329
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,710
可以友好地竞争
would remain friendly.

330
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:04,220
哦  麦克  我听说你是个水管工
Oh, Mike, I heard you're a plumber.

331
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,120
但是她想起来  在男人的问题上
But she was reminded that when it came to men...

332
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,660
你一会能过来看看我家的管道吗
Do you think you could stop by later and take a look at my pipes?

333
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,190
-女人不会公平竞争  -没问题
- ...Women don't fight fair. - Sure.

334
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:15,950
谢啦
Thanks.

335
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,400
拜  苏珊
Bye, Susan.

336
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:25,340
你别想像管小孩那样指挥我
You can't order me around like I am a child.

337
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,200
加布丽尔
Gabrielle.

338
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,600
不  我才不去
No, no. I'm not going.

339
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,770
这是生意  塔纳卡希望每人都携眷出席
It's business. Tanaka expects everyone to bring their wives.

340
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:34,210
每次我在那男人周围  他都想捏我的屁股
Every time I'm around that man, he tries to grab my ass.

341
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:37,440
去年我从他那赚了二十万
I made over 200,000 doing business with him last year.

342
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,540
如果他想捏你的屁股  让他捏
If he wants to grab your ass, you let him.

343
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,860
约翰
John.

344
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:53,630
索利斯先生  你吓到我了
Mr. Solis, you scared me.

345
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,570
那怎么还有杂草  你上周就该除掉的
Why is that bush there? You were supposed to dig it up last week.

346
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,940
-我没时间  -别找借口
- I didn't have time. - I don't want to hear your excuses.

347
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,200
把它处理好
Just take care of it.

348
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:06,310
我讨厌你跟我说话的语气
I really hate the way you talk to me.

349
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,640
我讨厌花一万五千块买条
And I hate that I spent $15,000 on your diamond necklace

350
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,340
没它你就活不下去的钻石项链
which you couldn't live without.

351
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:14,070
但是我学着接受了
But I'm learning to deal with it.

352
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,520
我能告诉塔纳卡我们明晚都会去了吗
So can I tell Tanaka we'll be there tomorrow?

353
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:20,580
约翰  邦迪在厨房的架子上
John, we have bandages top shelf in the kitchen.

354
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,030
谢谢  索利斯夫人
Thanks, Mrs. Solis.

355
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,530
好吧  我去
Fine, I'll go.

356
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,340
但是我会整晚
But I'm keeping my back pressed

357
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:32,200
都靠墙站着的
against the wall the entire time.

358
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:36,060
看到了吧  这就是婚姻的真谛
See, now this is what a marriage is all about.

359
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,110
妥协
Compromise.

360
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:47,450
-你手指没事吧  -没事  一个小口子而已
- Is your finger ok? - Yeah, it's just a small cut.

361
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:50,680
给我看看
Let me see. Mmm.

362
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:10,210
索利斯夫人  我喜欢和你亲热
You know, Mrs. Solis, I really like it when we hook up,

363
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,480
但是  我还有活要干
but, um, you know, I got to get my work done and...

364
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,070
我可丢不起这份工作
...I can't afford to lose this job.

365
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,440
这张桌子可是纯手工雕刻
This table was hand-carved.

366
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,090
卡洛斯从意大利进购的
Carlos had it imported from Italy.

367
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,890
花了他$23000
It cost him $23,000.

368
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,090
你这次想在桌子上做吗
You want to do it on the table this time?

369
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,720
当然了
Absolutely.

370
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,950
我们不能喝普通一点的汤吗
Why can't we ever have normal soup?

371
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,680
丹妮尔  罗勒汤就很普通啊
Danielle, there is nothing abnormal about basil puree.

372
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:55,330
就一次
Just once,

373
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:57,120
喝一点大家都知道的汤
couldn't we have a soup that people have heard of?

374
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,490
例如法式洋葱汤  或者菜豆汤
Like French onion or navy bean.

375
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,560
首先  你爸爸对洋葱过敏
First of all, your father can't eat onions.

376
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,060
那是致命的
He's deathly allergic. And I won't

377
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:06,900
再说我也不认为菜豆汤是个好主意
even dignify your navy bean suggestion.

378
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:09,960
炖小牛胫味道怎么样
So... how's the osso buco?

379
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:13,160
-还可以  -只是还可以
- It's ok. - It's ok?

380
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,470
安德鲁  我花了三小时做这顿饭
Andrew, I spent three hours cooking this meal.

381
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,570
但别人却随口敷衍一句
How do you think it makes me feel when you

382
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:20,570
"还可以"  想想我的感受
say "it's okay" in that sullen tone?

383
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:23,010
没人让你花三小时准备晚饭
Who asked you to spend three hours on dinner?

384
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,950
你说什么
Excuse me?

385
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,980
汤姆·哈伯的妈妈工作回来后
Tim Harper's mom gets home from work,

386
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,720
直接打开一些猪肉和豆子罐头
pops open a can of pork and beans,

387
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,920
然后热热闹闹的吃饭  大家都很开心
and boom, they're eating. Everyone's happy.

388
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,750
你宁愿我做猪肉和豆子吗
You'd rather I serve pork and beans?

389
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,400
我求你赶紧道歉
Apologize now. I am begging.

390
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,110
我的意思是
I'm saying,

391
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,520
有必要总是显摆你的厨艺吗
do you always have to serve cuisine?

392
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,300
难道我们就不能简单地吃顿饭
Can't we ever just have food?

393
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:44,390
-你嗑药了么  -什么
- Are you doing drugs? - What?

394
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,500
行为异常就是嗑药的表现
Change in behavior is one of the warning signs,

395
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,270
在此之前的
and you have been as fresh as

396
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,870
半年里你都很正常
paint for the last six months.

397
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,290
我想这就是
That certainly would explain

398
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,450
你经常躲在卫生间的原因
why you're always locked in the bathroom.

399
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:54,120
相信我  他在卫生间可不是干这事
Trust me, that is not what he is doing.

400
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,780
闭嘴
Shut up.

401
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,610
妈妈  有问题的不是我
Mom, I'm not the one with the problem here, all right?

402
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,880
你才是那个表现得
You're the one always acting like

403
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,710
像要竞选市长的
she's running for mayor of Stepford.

404
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,990
雷克斯  作为一家之主
Rex... Seeing that you're the head of this household,

405
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,320
你得说些什么吧
I would really appreciate you saying something.

406
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,960
把盐给我
Pass thee salt?

407
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,400
葬礼过去三天后
Three days after my funeral,

408
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:29,510
勒奈特不再悲伤了
Lynette replaced her grief with a much more useful emotion.

409
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,640
而是愤怒
Indignation.

410
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,640
汤姆  这是我第五次给你留言了
Tom, this is my fifth message,

411
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,550
可你还不回电话给我
and you still haven't called me back.

412
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,230
好吧  看来你这次出差其乐无穷
Well, you must be having a lot of fun

413
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,580
我只能这样想了
on your business trip. I can only imagine.

414
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:42,390
我想我和孩子们也要出去玩玩了
Well, guess what -- The kids and I want to have some fun, too,

415
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,280
除非你在中午之前给我回电话
so unless you call me back by noon,

416
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,300
否则我们会坐飞机过来找你
we are getting on a plane and joining you.

417
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,330
妈妈
Mom.

418
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:49,430
现在不行  我正威胁爸爸呢
Not now. Mommy's threatening daddy.

419
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,170
-妈妈  -不行
- Mom. - No, I...

420
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,540
-哥哥们呢  -面条  我的最爱
- Where are your brothers? - Noodles, my favorite.

421
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:04,710
-勒奈特·斯加沃  -该死的
- Lyneettee Scavo? - Crap.

422
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:08,380
娜塔丽·柯莱恩  真不敢相信
Natalie Klein. I don't believe it.

423
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:11,360
勒奈特  我们多久没见了
Lynette. How long has it been?

424
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,380
有些年头了  过的怎么样
Years. Uh, how are you?

425
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:14,550
公司还好吗
How's the firm?

426
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:17,860
很好  大家都很想你
Good. Everyone misses you.

427
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,810
大家都说如果你不走的话
We all say if you hadn't quit,

428
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,330
现在肯定是老板了
you'd be running the place by now.

429
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,870
是啊
Yeah, well.

430
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:28,640
家庭生活怎么样
So... How's domestic life?

431
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:31,010
做全职妈妈感觉怎样
Don't you just love being a mom?

432
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,450
麻烦来了  勒奈特最怕别人问这个问题
And there it was. The question that Lynette always dreaded.

433
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,240
说实话
Well, to be honest...

434
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:41,010
对于这个问题  答案只有一个
For those who asked it, only one answer was acceptable,

435
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:44,920
所以勒奈特和往常一样说了谎
So Lynette responded as she always did. She lied.

436
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,860
这是有史以来最棒的工作
It's the best job I've ever had.

437
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,670
-知道我好奇什么吗  -什么
- You know what I don't get? - What?

438
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,680
你为什么要和索利斯先生结婚
Why you married Mr. Solis.

439
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:10,000
因为他能给我
Well... He promised to give me

440
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,950
任何我想要的东西
everything I've ever wanted.

441
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,180
-他做到了吗  -是的
- And did he? - Yes.

442
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:19,720
那你为什么不开心
Then why aren't you happy?

443
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,860
看来我得到的都不是真正想要的
Turns out I wanted all the wrong things.

444
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:29,370
那你爱他吗
So do you love him?

445
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,940
是的
I do.

446
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,340
那我们为什么还在这偷情
Well, then, why are we here? Why are we doing this?

447
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:36,670
因为我可不想某天醒来
Because I don't want to wake up one morning

448
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:39,640
想把自己的脑袋打爆
with a sudden urge to blow my brains out.

449
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:46,980
-我能抽根吗  -当然不行
- Hey, can I have a drag? - Absolutely not.

450
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:50,650
对你来说  抽烟还太早
You are much too young to smoke.

451
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,890
如果我用你的抚养费去做整形手术
How would you feel about me using your

452
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,050
你觉得怎样
child-support payments for plastic surgery?

453
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,830
别那么紧张
Stop being so nervous. You're just

454
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:59,600
你只是约他吃饭  没什么大不了的
asking him to dinner. No big deal.

455
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,360
你说的对
You're right.

456
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,300
那是你的作业吗
So is that your project for school?

457
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,830
五年级的时候
You know, when I was in fifth grade,

458
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:07,600
我用糖块做出了白宫
I made the White House out of sugar cubes.

459
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,580
别磨蹭了  赶紧去
Stop stalling and go.

460
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,300
在麦克有更好的选择之前
Before Mike figures out he can do better.

461
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:16,210
我为什么要争夺你的抚养权
Tell me again why I fought for custody of you.

462
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,450
-你想气气爸爸  -说得好
- You were using me to hurt dad. - Oh, that's right.

463
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,710
天哪
Oh, god.

464
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,860
-嗨  -嗨  苏珊
- Hi. - Hey, Susan.

465
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:35,970
你在忙吗
Are you busy?

466
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,370
不忙  怎么了
No, not at all. What's up?

467
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:42,740
我只是在想
Well, I... I just, uh, was wondering if...

468
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:45,540
你是否有时间
...if there was any chance that you, uh...

469
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,480
我想问你
...I just wanted to ask if...

470
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,140
-伊迪  -嗨  苏珊
- Edie. - Hey, there, Susan.

471
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:56,810
-你怎么  -我刚做了些食物
- What are you...? - I was making ambrosia.

472
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:58,830
不过我一个人吃不了
And I made too much so I thought

473
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,660
所以就拿过来和麦克一起分享
I'd bring some over to Mike.

474
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,670
怎么了
What's going on?

475
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:03,630
苏珊正打算问我什么
Susan was just going to ask me something.

476
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,830
-我家水管堵住了  -什么
- I have a clog. - Excuse me?

477
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,970
-你是个水管工  不是吗  -是的
- And you're a plumber, right? - Yeah.

478
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,970
-水管里有东西堵住了  -是啊
- The clog's in the pipe. - Yeah,

479
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,710
通常问题都在那
That's usually where they are.

480
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,530
是啊  就是这种情况
Well, I've got one.

481
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,440
好吧  我去拿下工具
Ok. Let me get my tools.

482
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,210
现在就过去修理吗  你这还有伴呢
Now? You want to come over now? You have company.

483
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,690
我不介意
I don't mind.

484
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:32,020
等我2分钟  马上就过来
Just give me two minutes. I'll be right over.

485
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,700
就这样
That's it.

486
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:44,700
-赶紧用头发把它塞满  -我塞了
- Just stuff the hair down there. - I stuffed it.

487
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,570
-但还是不能堵住  -好吧
- It's not enough to clog it. - Here. Okay, look.

488
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,670
把花生酱也倒进去
Put in this peanut butter

489
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,440
还有烹饪油
and this cooking oil.

490
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:56,140
-妈妈  -还有这些橄榄
- Mom - And these olives.

491
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,280
妈妈  我说了  这些都没用
Mom, I'm telling you, it's not working.

492
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:02,050
我的天哪  他来了
Oh, god. That's him.

493
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,920
我该怎么办
How am I going to stop up the sink?

494
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:14,860
好了  问题在这里
Well, here's your problem.

495
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,220
看来有人把一堆冰棒棍子
Looks like somebody stuffed

496
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,230
扔了进来
a bunch of popsicle sticks down here.

497
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,470
我告诉朱莉无数次
I've told Julie a million times

498
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,630
不要在厨房打闹  但是小孩都这样
not to play in the kitchen. Kids, you know.

499
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,400
好的  我这就去做准备
All right, I'll go put in your orders,

500
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,550
马上把你们的饮料
And I'll be right back with your drinks

501
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,580
和装沙拉用的盘子拿来
and your plates for the salad bar.

502
00:26:33,690 --> 00:26:35,810
谢谢
Thank you.

503
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,380
安德鲁  丹妮尔  摆好餐巾
Andrew, Danielle, napkins?

504
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,990
这儿有电视游戏
They have video games.

505
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,290
我们能过去玩玩吗  菜上了就回来
Could we go play until our food gets here?

506
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:47,150
安德鲁  这是家庭聚餐  我想我们
Andrew, this is family time. I think that we should all

507
00:26:47,150 --> 00:26:48,660
去玩吧
Go ahead and play.

508
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,370
也许你认为我不喜欢这种地方
I know that you think I'm angry about coming here,

509
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,900
其实不是
but I'm not.

510
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,880
你和孩子们想换个有趣点的环境
You and the kids wanted a change of pace,

511
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,360
我明白
something fun I get it.

512
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,610
说不定你们明天晚上
Probably we'll want

513
00:27:07,610 --> 00:27:08,850
就想吃些健康点的食物了
something healthier tomorrow night, though.

514
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,350
我打算做些煎鸡肉卷
I'm thinking about chicken Saltimbocca.

515
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,220
我们离婚吧
I want a divorcee.

516
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:18,290
我实在不能忍受
I just can't live in this...

517
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,600
这种毫无瑕疵的生活
...this detergent commercial anymore

518
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,760
沙拉台就在那边  请随便享用
The salad bar's right over there. Help yourself.

519
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,100
谢谢
Thank you.

520
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,540
我去帮你拿些沙拉
Um, I think I'll go get your salad for you.

521
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:50,090
-布里·范德坎普  -你好  胡博太太
- Bree Van De Kamp. - Oh. Hello, Mrs. Huber.

522
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,800
在玛丽·艾莉丝的追思会上
We didn't get a chance to talk at

523
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,060
我们都没有好好聊过  最近怎么样
Mary Alice's wake. How are you doing?

524
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,490
布里很想和她分享
Bree longed to share the truth about

525
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,430
丈夫背叛了自己的事
her husband's painful betrayal,

526
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,830
悲哀的是
but sadly for Bree,

527
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:04,770
布里绝不会承认自己是失败者
admitting defeat was not an option.

528
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:08,710
很好  一切都很好
Great. Everything is just great.

529
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:11,200
我给你的沙拉浇了蜂蜜黄芥末酱
Okay, well, I got you the honey mustard dressing.

530
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,740
看起来很田园
The ranch looked just a little bit suspect.

531
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:25,620
能继续刚才的谈话吗
Are we going to talk about what I said?

532
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,570
我才不会在这个用"美眉"和"帅哥"
If you think I'm going to discuss the dissolution

533
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,740
作为洗手间标示的地方
of my marriage in a place

534
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,780
讨论我们的婚姻问题
where the restrooms are labeled "chicks" and "dudes,"

535
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,640
你疯了吧
you're out of your mind.

536
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:36,740
这里面有什么
What's in this?

537
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,940
还能是什么  沙拉啊
What do you mean, what's in this? It's salad.

538
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,180
-里面有洋葱  -什么
- With... with onions. - What?

539
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:45,310
-你在里面放了洋葱  -我没有
- You put onions in my salad. - No, I didn't.

540
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,360
怎么会这样
Oh, wait.

541
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:01,720
惊醒我儿子的声音
The sound that awakened my son was

542
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,900
在他还很小的时候
something he'd heard only once before.

543
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:07,530
听到过一次
Many years ago when he was quite young.

544
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,340
但他马上就明白了
But he recognized it instantly.

545
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,650
这声音是我们家的秘密
It was the sound of a family secret.

546
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:46,070
葬礼过去七天后
Seven days after my funeral, life on Wisteria Lane

547
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:49,270
紫藤郡人的生活重归正常
finally returned to normal.

548
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:53,720
对于我的某些朋友来说  生活并不尽如人意
Which, for some of my friends, was unfortunate.

549
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,450
-妈妈  妈妈  -又怎么了
- Mommy, mommy! - Now what?

550
00:29:58,530 --> 00:30:01,490
爸爸回来了
Daddy's home!

551
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:04,890
过来  家里有人吗
Come on! Hey, is anybody home?

552
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,660
我以为你不打算回来了
I wasn't expecting you for a week.

553
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,210
我今天上午得赶回旧金山
I have to go back to 'Frisco in the morning.

554
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:15,500
但我收到你的留言了  你听起来你很憔悴
But I got your call. You sounded frazzled.

555
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,800
没错
Yeah.

556
00:30:16,910 --> 00:30:20,110
-我的确有点累  -嗯  桃子味
- It's been a little rough. - Hi. Yeah. Peaches.

557
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,010
你给我们带礼物了吗
Did you buy us any presents?

558
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,910
对了  礼物  等一下  我找找
Oh, god, presents. Wait up. Let me see.

559
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,250
-在这儿  -太棒了
- Ohhh! - Yeah!

560
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,340
但你们得保证  现在就到外面去
But I'm not giving it to you unless

561
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,420
练二十分钟投球
you promise to go outside right now

562
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,090
我才能把球给你们  行吗
and practise throwing for 20 minutes. You promise?

563
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,690
-好耶  好耶  -孩子们  快去吧
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! - Punks. Get out!

564
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:45,670
谁来开球  出去  再远点儿  触地得分
Who's open? Go out. Deeper. Deeper. Touchdown!

565
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,610
天哪
Oh, my god.

566
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:52,670
别这样
Oh, no.

567
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,800
你开玩笑吧  我累瘫了
You got to be kidding. I'm exhausted.

568
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,480
身上一团糟  还都是桃子味
I look terrible. I'm covered in peaches.

569
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:01,130
抱歉了  宝贝  我控制不了了
I'm sorry, baby. I got to have you.

570
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,820
我能不能就这么躺着
Well, is it ok if I just lie here?

571
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,950
当然可以
Absolutely.

572
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:12,130
-我爱你  -我更爱你
- I love you. - I love you more.

573
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,600
等等  我有点肿胀的毛病
Wait. I gotta tell you I was having trouble with swelling.

574
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,000
医生不让我吃避孕药了
The doctor took me off the pill.

575
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,500
你得把套子戴上
You just gotta put on a condom.

576
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:21,040
-戴套子  -没错
- A condom? - Yeah.

577
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:23,840
没什么大不了的  我们就赌一把吧
What's the big deal? Let's risk it.

578
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,970
-赌一把  -对啊
- Let's risk it? - Yeah.

579
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,360
真没想到你会想要杀了我
I can't believe you tried to kill me.

580
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,420
我很抱歉
Yes, well, I feel badly about that.

581
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,850
我说过了  胡博太太当时走过来
I told you Mrs. Huber came over

582
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:45,060
我走神了  是我不小心而已
and I got distracted. It was a mistake.

583
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,990
你怎么会有疏忽的时候
Since when do you make mistakes?

584
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,160
这话什么意思
What does that mean?

585
00:31:48,230 --> 00:31:50,810
你永远都让事情保持完美
It means I'm sick of you being

586
00:31:50,810 --> 00:31:53,470
这让我无法忍受
so damn perfect all the time.

587
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,840
我讨厌你的头发总是一丝不苟
I'm sick of the bizarre way your hair doesn't move.

588
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,860
我讨厌早晨我还没去洗手间
I'm sick of you making our bed in the

589
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,010
你就已经把床铺好了
morning before I've used the bathroom.

590
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,610
你简直就是个人造的完美家庭主妇
You're this plastic suburban housewife,

591
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:05,410
戴着珍珠项链  拿着刮铲
with her pearls and spatula,

592
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:08,820
嘴里说着  "我们得请亨德森一家吃顿饭"
who says things like "we owe the Hendersons a dinner."

593
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,450
我一见倾心的女人去哪儿了
Where's the woman I fell in love with...

594
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,660
那个会把面包烤焦
...Who used to burn the toast and

595
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,860
喝纸盒牛奶的女人
drink milk out of the carton?

596
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,030
会放声大笑的女人
and laugh.

597
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,190
我想念她了
I need her.

598
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:32,470
而不是现在这样完美却冷酷的
Not this cold, perfect thing you've become.

599
00:32:39,850 --> 00:32:41,980
这花该换水了
These need water.

600
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:58,570
布里在洗手间里安静的抽泣了五分钟
Bree sobbed quietly in the restroom for five minutes,

601
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,730
但她丈夫不知道
but her husband never knew.

602
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,270
因为当她出来的时候
Because when Bree finally emerged...

603
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,480
她又完美如初
...she was perfect.

604
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,890
我找到耳环了  可以走了
I found my earrings. We can go now.

605
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,990
约翰今天来过吗

来过啊
Well, yeah.

607
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,510
草坪根本没修剪  我受够了
The lawn hasn't been mowed. I've had it.

608
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,260
得换个专业园丁了
We're getting a real gardener.

609
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,700
-为什么  -你没听见吗
- Why? - Are you deaf?

610
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:31,430
他根本没完成他的活儿
I just said he's not doing his job.

611
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,340
天太黑了  你看不出来草坪已经剪过了
It's dark. You just can't see the lawn has been mowed.

612
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,950
就是没有  看看这草
It hasn't been. Feel this grass.

613
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,500
我怎么看不到
I'm not feeling the grass.

614
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,910
快走吧  我们要迟到了
Let's just get going. Come on, we're late.

615
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:49,010
-把车停好  -是  先生

616

塔纳卡在那边  轮到我大显身手了
There's Tanaka. Time for me to go and do my dance.

618
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,400
-等一下  -你好
- Excuse me. - Ma'am.

619
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,570
看到那个刚走开的男人了吗
You see that man just walked away?

620
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:12,940
你能保证他今晚手里一直都有酒吗
Can you make sure he has a drink in his hand all night long?

621
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,080
好的  女士
Yes, ma'am.

622
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:54,670
-苏珊  苏珊  -胡博太太  近来可好
- Susan? Susan! - Mrs. Huber, how are you doing?

623
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,830
不算太好
Not too well, I'm afraid.

624
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,910
我想找点治胃病的药
I'm trying to find something to soothe my stomach.

625
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:01,320
-胃不舒服  -对啊
- It's upset? - Yeah.

626
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,550
我在追思会上吃了超难吃的奶酪通心粉
I had the worst macaroni and cheese at the wake.

627
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:05,690
然后胃就一直没舒服过
It's been running through me ever since.

628
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:07,580
我得赶紧好起来
And I need to be at my best.

629
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,890
伊迪·布利特的儿子今晚要来我家过夜
Edie Britt's son is spending the night tonight.

630
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,390
他要在你家过夜
He's spending the night?

631
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:15,590
伊迪要和一位先生共进晚餐
Apparently Edie is having a gentleman friend over for dinner,

632
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,970
我猜她打算狂欢一整夜
and I think she plans on entertaining into the wee hours,

633
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:21,130
你明白我的意思吧
if you know what I mean.

634
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:25,800
这有些抗酸剂  你服过这种药吗
Oh, here's some antacid. Have you ever tried this?

635
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,750
难以置信  怎么可能呢
I can't believe it. This can't be happening.

636
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:32,110
比起我  麦克不会更喜欢伊迪的  不可能
Mike can't like Edie better than me. He just can't.

637
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,210
你又不知道究竟会发生什么事
You don't know what's going on.

638
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:36,620
没准儿他们就是吃个饭而已
Maybe they're just having dinner.

639
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,320
你说得没错  他们要上床了
You're right. They're doing it.

640
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,900
伊迪
Edie?

641
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,580
伊迪
Edie?

642
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:16,720
有人在家吗
Hello? Anybody home?

643
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,590
我要借点糖
I need to borrow sugar.

644
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:43,020
上帝啊  就是这样  给我
Oh, my god! Oh, yes! Give it to me!

645
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:46,990
就这样  苏珊对麦克·德尔非诺抱有的
And just like that, the possibility Susan had clung to,

646
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:51,470
最后一点幻想  也破灭了
the maybe of Mike Delfino, was gone forever.

647
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,860
尽管她心绪难平
And despite the precariousness of her situation,

648
00:37:56,940 --> 00:37:59,930
苏珊还是坐下来伤了一会儿心
Susan took a moment to mourn her loss.

649
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:29,230
苏珊马上就发现
It didn't take Susan long to realize,

650
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,190
今天晚上她注定倒霉
this was just not her night.

651
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:35,070
是谁在楼下
Is somebody out there?

652
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,370
上帝啊  冒烟了
Oh, my god! That's smoke!

653
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:55,220
天哪
Oh, my god.

654
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:58,120
她把点燃的蜡烛丢在外间里
She left candles unattended in the den.

655
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,720
医生说她已经很幸运了
Paramedic said she was lucky.

656
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,190
她本来可能会死的
She could've been killed.

657
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,370
她什么都没穿就跑了出来
She ran out with nothing on.

658
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:07,040
起火的时候她和别人做爱呢
She was having sex with some guy when the fire started.

659
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:08,970
那人怎么样了
What happened to him?

660
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,770
他吸入了烟雾  送医院了
He got smoke inhalation. He's at the hospital.

661
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:16,070
苏珊  你没事吧  你脸色不对劲啊
Susan, are you all right? You look awful.

662
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:22,710
我没事  没事  我只是  为伊迪感到遗憾
I'm fine. I'm fine. I just, uh, feel really bad for Edie.

663
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:25,790
宝贝儿  不用为她担心  她很坚强的
Oh, honey, don't worry about Edie. She's a strong lady.

664
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:28,200
没错  她能挺过来的
Absolutely. She'll get through this.

665
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,060
她总有办法渡过难关
She'll find a way to survive.

666
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,390
我们都是如此
We all do.

667
00:39:35,530 --> 00:39:37,800
走吧
Come on.

668
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:57,350
-天啊  怎么回事  -麦克
- Wow! What happened? - Mike!

669
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,190
突然间  他出现了
And suddenly there he was.

670
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:01,830
像是浴火重生的凤凰
Like a phoenix rising from the ashes.

671
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:06,190
我以为你在  你去哪儿了
I... I thought you were... Uh... Where were you?

672
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,830
我刚从电影院回来  伊迪家着火了是吗
I just got back from the movies. Edie had a fire, huh?

673
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:14,740
是啊  不过她现在没事了
Yeah. Yeah, but she's fine now.

674
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,810
一切都没事了
Everything's fine now.

675
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:19,850
就这样  苏珊很高兴
And just like that, Susan was happy.

676
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:24,610
她的生活又充满了无限可能
Life was suddenly full of... possibilities.

677
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,690
更别说一些意外的"惊喜"了
Not to mention a few unexpected surprises.

678
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,060
-喂  -是我
- Hello. - It's me.

679
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,260
-有消息了吗  -还没有
- Have anything yet? - No, nothing yet.

680
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:46,430
不过别着急  我快要得手了
But don't worry. I'm definitely getting closer.

681
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,250
我带了些香槟
I brought some champagne.

682
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,580
我觉得我们应该喝一杯
I thought we should have a toast.

683
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,810
第二天  我的朋友们一起过来
The next day my friends came together

684
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:02,480
把我的衣服  私人物品
to pack away my clothes,

685
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:07,080
还有我留下的一切痕迹都清理走
my personal belongings and what was left of my life.

686
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:10,790
好了  姑娘们  举杯吧
All right, ladies, lift 'em up.

687
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,990
敬玛丽·艾莉丝  好朋友  好邻居
To Mary Alice, a good friend and neighbor.

688

无论你身在何处  愿你能寻得平静
Wherever you are, we hope you've found peace.

689
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:19,260
-敬玛丽·艾莉丝  -敬玛丽·艾莉丝
- To Mary Alice. - To Mary Alice.

690
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,910
好好整理一下吧
Let's get this show on the road.

691
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:30,470
你们快来看看玛丽·艾莉丝的衣服
You guys, check out Mary Alice's clothes.

692
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:34,450
八号的  她一直说她穿六号
Size eight? Ha! She always told me she was a size six.

693
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:37,110
她的小秘密曝光了
We found the skeleton in her closet.

694
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:39,080
这不算秘密  加布丽尔  还有呢
Not quite, Gabrielle, not quite.

695
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,960
-那是什么  -一封给玛丽·艾莉丝的信
- What's that? - A letter addressed to Mary Alice.

696
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:44,090
真是讽刺
How ironic.

697
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,160
我一直以来要保守的秘密
To have something I tried so desperately to keep secret,

698
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,600
如此轻易地被发现了
treated so casually.

699
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,510
你干什么呢  这是隐私
What are you doing? That's private.

700
00:41:50,510 --> 00:41:52,260
这已经打开了  没关系的
It's open. What's the big deal?

701
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,260
我知道你干的好事  真恶心  我要告诉别人

702
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,490
这是什么意思
What does this mean?

703
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:07,510
不知道  不过看这邮戳
I don't know. But check out the postmark.

704
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:10,350
天哪  是她自杀那天收到的
Oh, my god. She got it the day she died.

705
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,650
会不会就是因为这个她
Do you think this is why she...?

706
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,950
对不起  姐妹们
I'm so sorry, girls.

707
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,290
我本不想让你们卷进来
I never wanted you to be burdened with this.

708
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:24,800
玛丽·艾莉丝  你做了什么
Oh, Mary Alice, what did you do?
